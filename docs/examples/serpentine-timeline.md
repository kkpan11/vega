The serpentine timeline is a niche use case. The serpentine axis can be an option for instances where an oblong canvas is not ideal. This example demonstrates how more complicated position and rotation encodings can be achieved through a series of transforms. The shape can be customized via the included signals, and input bindings have been added for demonstration purposes.
